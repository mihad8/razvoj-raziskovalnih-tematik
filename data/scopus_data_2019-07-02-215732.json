Field recordings are integral documents of folk music performances captured in the field, and typically contain performances, intertwined with interviews and commentaries. As these are live recordings, captured in non-ideal conditions, they usually contain significant background noise. We present a segmentation method that segments field recordings into individual units labelled as speech, solo singing, choir singing, and instrumentals. Classification is based on convolutional deep networks, and is augmented with a probabilistic approach for segmentation. We describe the dataset gathered for the task and the tools developed for gathering the reference annotations. We outline a deep network architecture based on residual modules for labelling short audio segments and compare it to the more standard feature based approaches, where an improvement in classification accuracy of over 10% was obtained. We also present the SeFiRe segmentation tool that incorporates the presented segmentation method. \u00a9 2019 by the authors."},

It remains unclear whether the specific subgroups share the same involvement and whether the effect is delayed. (2) Methods: Data for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) incidences from 2008 to 2011 were gathered in two major medical centres in Slovenia. A time series analysis was conducted in which daily ACS incidence data were linked with daily concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> (PM with a median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 \u03bcm) using a well-established generalized linear model with a log link function and a Poisson distribution of ACS.We specifically focused on groups based simultaneously on age and gender. (3) Results: On the basis of the presented models, it appears that daily average concentrations of PM<sub>10</sub> have a significant impact on ACS incidence for the entire population, with a higher impact on older populations and the highest impact on older men. The analysis of the delayed effect in PM<sub>10</sub>-related ACS incidences observed the strongest effect at a one day lag. (4) Conclusions: Our study detected the presence of a \"rise and fall\" lag pattern observed in three aforementioned population groups; however, no significant association was detected for women and younger populations. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

This article presents a computer-supported model based on this framework and a multi-attribute decision-making methodology named, DEX. The model was built by a group of experts and tested on selected schools in Slovenia. The main advantages of the model are: the use of qualitative value scales for attributes which do not have exact values; the use of a hierarchical structure for attributes; a transparent presentation of the interconnectedness of these attributes; and the use of simple if\u2013then aggregation rules to allow the use of non-fixed weights. An application of our model to a selected school demonstrates the potential for knowledge modelling to facilitate upgrades of existing assessment tools and to provide a better understanding and analysis of assessment results. \u00a9 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."},

However, the node mobility and efficient cross-layer communication between the overlay and MANET routing protocols remains a challenge for reliable data transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel Mobility Aware Cross-layer Routing approach for Peer-to-Peer Networks (MACARON) over MANET. MACARON provides reliable communication and high lifetime routes to support efficient data transmission in the network. For this purpose, it uses cross-layer communications to share routing updates between MANET and overlay routing protocols. MACARON provides guaranteed routes with low path stretch by maintaining O\u02dc(n) routing entries per node, where n is the number of nodes in the network. It provides scalability without using any landmark directory to store routing state, and it can effectively handle moderate mobility by using Last Encounter Routing (LER) protocol. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd"},

In particular, RBMXL2 represses the selection of aberrant splice sites and the insertion of cryptic and premature terminal exons. Our data suggest a Rbmxl2 retrogene has been conserved across mammals as part of a splicing control mechanism that is fundamentally important to germ cell biology. We propose that this mechanism is essential to meiosis because it buffers the high ambient concentrations of splicing activators, thereby preventing poisoning of key transcripts and disruption to gene expression by aberrant splice site selection. \u00a9 2019, Ehrmann et al."},

Lowering the stimulation frequency may reduce these symptoms. The objectives of the current study were to establish the relationship between gait performance and STN-DBS frequency in chronically stimulated patients with PD, and to identify factors underlying variability in this relationship. Twenty-four patients treated chronically with STN-DBS (&gt;4 years) were studied off-medication. The effect of stimulation frequency (40\u2013140 Hz, 20 Hz-steps, constant energy) on gait was assessed in 6 sessions spread over 1 day. Half of the trials/session involved walking through a narrow doorway. The influence of stimulation voltage was investigated separately in 10 patients. Gait was measured using 3D motion capture and axial symptoms severity was assessed clinically. A novel statistical method established the optimal frequency(ies) for each patient by operating on frequency-tuning curves for multiple gait parameters. Narrowly-tuned optimal frequencies (20 Hz bandwidth) were found in 79% of patients. Frequency change produced a larger effect on gait performance than voltage change. Optimal frequency varied between patients (between 60 and 140 Hz). Contact site in the right STN and severity of axial symptoms were independent predictors of optimal frequency (P = 0.009), with lower frequencies associated with more dorsal contacts and worse axial symptoms. We conclude that gait performance is sensitive to small changes in STN-DBS frequency. The optimal frequency varies considerably between patients and is associated with electrode contact site and severity of axial symptoms. Between-subject variability of optimal frequency may stem from variable pathology outside the basal ganglia.

To design the adaptive transmission schemes, it is important to understand the realistic channel properties, especially in vehicular environments where the mobility of communication devices causes rapid channel variation. However, getting CSI estimates is challenging due to the lack of support for obtaining CSI from the chipset. In this paper, we present our efforts towards enabling reliable, up-to-date channel estimates in vehicular communications. We begin by designing and conducting a measurement campaign where we collect IQ (in-phase and quadrature) samples of the IEEE 802.11p transmission and implement CSI extraction algorithms to obtain and analyze wireless channel estimates from various real-world environments. We then propose a deep learning-based channel prediction for predicting future CSI and received signal levels. The trace-based evaluation demonstrates that our prediction approach improves the future power level estimate by 15% to 25% in terms of the root-mean-square-error compared to the latest known channel properties, thus, providing a sound basis for future efforts in anticipatory vehicular communication transmission adaptation. \u00a9 2019 IEEE."},

The expected workload, Quality of Service (QoS) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) must be considered before an appropriate infrastructure is selected. However, this decision-making process is complex and time-consuming. Moreover, the software engineer needs assurances that the selected infrastructure will lead to an adequate QoS of the application. Objective: The goal is to develop a new method for selection of an optimal cloud deployment option, that is, an infrastructure and configuration for deployment and to verify that all hard and as many soft QoS requirements as possible will be met at runtime. Method: A new Formal QoS Assurances Method (FoQoSAM), which relies on stochastic Markov models is introduced to facilitate an automated decision-making process. For a given workload, it uses QoS monitoring data and a user-related metric in order to automatically generate a probabilistic model. The probabilistic model takes the form of a finite automaton. It is further used to produce a rank list of cloud deployment options. As a result, any of the cloud deployment options can be verified by applying a probabilistic model checking approach. Results: Testing was performed by ranking deployment options for two cloud applications, File Upload and Video-conferencing. The FoQoSAM method was compared to a baseline Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results show that the first ranked cloud deployment options satisfy all hard and at least one of the soft requirements for both methods, however, the FoQoSAM method always satisfies at least an additional QoS requirement compared to the baseline AHP method. Conclusions: The proposed new FoQoSAM method is appropriate and can be used in decision-making when ranking and verifying cloud deployment options. Due to its practical utility it was integrated into the SWITCH workbench. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V."},

Put another way, sonicLamination is not just about a new kind of conceptual art, but about exploring new venues in fine arts through technology. Therefore, this paper presents how sonicLamination can be used to exceed its conceptual roots in order to lead to new ways of artistic deployment ranging from enhancing humans sensations to artificially generated soundscapes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether combined preoperative non-invasive determination of cardiac autonomic regulation and PR interval allows for the identification of patients at risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. Methods: RR, PR and QT intervals, and linear and non-linear heart rate variability parameters from 20 min high-resolution electrocardiographic recordings were determined one day before surgery in 150 patients on chronic beta blockers undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement, or both, electively. Results: Thirty-one patients (21%)developed postoperative atrial fibrillation. In the atrial fibrillation group, more arterial hypertension, a greater age, a higher EuroSCORE II, a higher heart rate variability index (pNN50: 9 \u00b1 20 vs. 4 \u00b1 10, p = 0.050), a short PR interval (156 \u00b1 23 vs. 173 \u00b1 31 ms; p = 0.011), and a reduced short-term scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA1, 0.96 \u00b1 0.36 vs. 1.11 \u00b1 0.30 ms; p = 0.032)were found compared to the sinus rhythm group. Logistic regression modeling confirmed PR interval, DFA1 and age as the strongest preoperative predictors of postoperative atrial fibrillation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.804). Conclusions: Patients developing atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery presented with severe cardiac autonomic derangement and a short PR interval preoperatively. The observed state characterizes both altered heart rate regulation and arrhythmic substrate and is strongly related to an increased risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V."},

As such, genetic variability in these pathways could have a role in susceptibility for the disease as well as in the treatment outcome. Dopaminergic treatment is effective in management of motor symptoms, but poses a risk for motor and non-motor adverse events. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress on Parkinson's disease susceptibility and the occurrence of adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. Methods: In total, 224 patients were enrolled, and their demographic and clinical data on the disease course were collected. Furthermore, a control group of 146 healthy Slovenian blood donors were included for Parkinson's disease' risk evaluation. Peripheral blood was obtained for DNA isolation. Genotyping was performed for NLRP3 rs35829419, CARD8 rs2043211, IL1\u03b2 rs16944, IL1\u03b2 rs1143623, IL6 rs1800795, CAT rs1001179, CAT rs10836235, SOD2 rs4880, NOS1 rs2293054, NOS1 rs2682826, TNF-\u03b1 rs1800629, and GPX1 rs1050450.

We did not find any associations between selected polymorphisms and motor adverse events. Conclusions: Apart from some nominally significant associations, one significant association between CAT genetic variability and peripheral edema was observed as well. Therefore, the results of our study suggest some links between genetic variability in inflammation- and oxidative stress-related pathways and non-motor adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. However, the investigated polymorphisms do not play a major role in the occurrence of the disease and the adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. \u00a9 2019 The Author(s)."},

Speech intelligibility (SI) and verbal fluency (VF) have been shown to deteriorate following chronic STN-DBS. It has been suggested that speech might respond favourably to low frequency stimulation (LFS). Objective: We examined how SI, perceptual speech characteristics, phonemic and semantic VF and processes underlying it (clustering and switching) respond to LFS of 60 and 80 Hz in comparison to high frequency stimulation (HFS) (110, 130 and 200 Hz). Methods: In this double-blind study, 15 STN-DBS PD patients (mean age 65, SD = 5.8, 14 right handed, three females), were assessed at five stimulation frequencies: 60 Hz, 80 Hz, 110 Hz, 130 Hz and 200 Hz. In addition to the clinical neurological assessment of speech, VF and SI were assessed. Results: SI and in particular articulation, respiration, phonation and prosody improved with LFS (all p &lt; 0.05). Phonemic VF switching improved with LFS (p = 0.005) but this did not translate to an improved phonemic VF score. A trend for improved semantic VF was found. A negative correlation was found between perceptual characteristics of speech and duration of chronic stimulation (all p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for meticulous programming of frequency to maximise SI in chronic STNDBS. The findings further implicate stimulation frequency in changes to specific processes underlying VF, namely phonemic switching and demonstrate the potential to address such deficits through advanced adjustment of stimulation parameters. \u00a9 2019 IOS Press and the authors.

In the same project, a web concordancer was designed for the broadest possible use, and tailored to the needs and abilities of user groups such as translators, writers, proofreaders and teachers. Two years after the corpus was published within the new tool, its features were assessed by the users. With an average rate of 4.36 on a scale between 1 and 5 (1 = I strongly disagree, 5 = I strongly agree), the results indicate that most survey participants agreed or strongly agreed with positive statements about the new implementations (e.g. \u201cThe corpus results are displayed in a clear manner\u201d). This is a considerable improvement in user experience from the previous reference corpus of Slovene, i.e. the FidaPLUS corpus within the ASP32 concordancer (rated with 3.67). In the user feedback, the simplicity of search options and the interface clarity are highlighted as the main advantages, while for the future development, advanced visualizations of corpus data and improved search of word-phrases are suggested. The evaluation also highlighted some relevant user habits, such as not taking the time to learn systematically about the tool before they start using it. The findings will be implemented in future editions of the Gigafida corpus, but are relevant to any project that aims at facilitating a wider use of reference corpora and corpus-based resources. \u00a9 2018, Springer Nature B.V."},

Since these estimates, in particular the former ones, are based on the training data from which the hypotheses themselves were constructed, they are usually optimistic. The paper shows three different solutions; two for the artificial boundary cases with the smallest and the largest optimism and a general correction procedure called extreme value correction (EVC) based on extreme value distribution. We demonstrate the application of the technique to rule learning, specifically to estimating classification accuracy of a single rule, and evaluate it on an artificial data set and on a number of UCI data sets. We observed that the correction successfully improved the accuracy estimates. We also describe an approach for combining rules into a linear global classifier and show that using EVC estimates leads to more accurate classifiers. \u00a9 2018, The Author(s)."},

Such biometrics can be captured at public places from a distance without subjects collaboration, awareness and even consent. However, there are still numerous challenges caused by influence of covariate factors like changes of walking speed, view, clothing, footwear etc., that have negative impact on recognition performance. In this paper we tackle walking speed changes with a skeleton model-based gait recognition system focusing on improving algorithm robustness and improving the performance at higher walking speed changes. We achieve these by proposing frame based classification method, which overcomes the main shortcoming of distance based classification methods, which are very sensitive to gait cycle starting point detection. The proposed technique is starting point invariant with respect to gait cycle starts and as such ensures independence of classification from gait cycle start positions. Additionally, we propose wavelet transform based signal approximation, which enables the analysis of feature signals on different frequency space resolutions and diminishes the need for using feature transformation that require training. With the evaluation on OU-ISIR gait dataset we demonstrate state of the art performance of proposed methods. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."},

Multiple kernel learning and kernel approximation are often treated as separate tasks, with considerable savings in time and memory expected if the two are performed simultaneously. Our proposed Mklaren algorithm selectively approximates multiple kernel matrices in regression. It uses Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition and Least-angle regression (LAR) to select basis functions, achieving linear complexity both in the number of data points and kernels. Since it approximates kernel matrices rather than functions, it allows to combine an arbitrary set of kernels. Compared to single kernel-based approximations, it selectively approximates different kernels in different regions of the input spaces. The LAR criterion provides a robust selection of inducing points in noisy settings, and an accurate modelling of regression functions in continuous and discrete input spaces. Among general kernel matrix decompositions, Mklaren achieves minimal approximation rank required for performance comparable to using the exact kernel matrix, at a cost lower than 1% of required operations. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and interpretability in settings with millions of data points and thousands of kernels. \u00a9 2019 The Authors"},

This is characterised by a tonic forward sway response that is reportedly diminished or absent in patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia. Objective: To investigating the impact of the sensory trick on vibration-induced postural responses. Methods: 20 patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia and a sensory trick, 15 patients without a trick, and 16 healthy controls were recruited. Neck muscle vibration was applied bilaterally over the upper trapezius under three different conditions: 1) Quiet standing; 2) standing while performing the trick (or trick-like movement in non-responders); 3) standing while elevating the flexed arm without touching any part of the body. Centre of pressure position and whole-body orientation in the sagittal plane were analysed. Results: Patients with a sensory trick responded similarly to healthy controls: neck muscle vibration led to an initial forward sway of the body that slowly increased during the prolonged vibration for all three conditions. This response was mainly mediated by ankle flexion. In patients without a trick, the initial sagittal sway was significantly reduced in all three conditions and the later slow increase was absent. Performance of the trick did not have an effect on any aspect of the response in either cervical dystonia group. Conclusions: The whole-body response to neck vibration in cervical dystonia differs depending on the effectiveness of the sensory trick to alleviate the dystonic neck posture. Variable pathophysiology of proprioceptive processing may be the common factor. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd"},

In this review paper, we deal with an in-depth analysis and comparison of 13 representative step length estimation models using smartphone inertial sensors: step-frequency-based, acceleration-based, angle-based, and multiparameter. Hereby, we have studied the influence of different walking speeds and four typical sensor positions on the models' performance. Results indicate that smartphone position affected the performance of most acceleration-based models derived from a gait model. Their performance deteriorated if smartphone was carried in hand or pocket. Walking speed affected the performance of models that include step frequency when tuned with personalized sets of constants. Most of them performed better for fast and normal walking speeds. During this research, we also established an open-source dataset that contains over 22 km of gait measurements obtained from a group of 15 healthy adults. \u00a9 2001-2012 IEEE."},

In this work we focus on the acquisition of pairwise preferences in the music domain. Asking the user to explicitly compare music, i.e., which, among two listened tracks, is preferred, requires some user effort. We have therefore developed a novel approach for automatically extracting these preferences from the analysis of the facial expressions of the users while listening to the compared tracks. We have trained a predictor that infers user's pairwise preferences by using features extracted from these data. We show that the predictor performs better than a commonly used baseline, which leverages the user's listening duration of the tracks to infer pairwise preferences. Furthermore, we show that there are differences in the accuracy of the proposed method between users with different personalities and we have therefore adapted the trained model accordingly. Our work shows that by introducing a low user effort preference elicitation approach, which, however, requires to access information that may raise potential privacy issues (face expression), one can obtain good prediction accuracy of pairwise music preferences. \u00a9 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
