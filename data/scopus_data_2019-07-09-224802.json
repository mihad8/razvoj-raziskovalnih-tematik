The proposed HINMINE methodology is based on previous work that classifies nodes in a heterogeneous network in two steps. In the first step the heterogeneous network is decomposed into one or more homogeneous networks using different connecting nodes. We improve this step by using new methods inspired by weighting of bag-of-words vectors mostly used in information retrieval. The methods assign larger weights to nodes which are more informative and characteristic for a specific class of nodes. In the second step, the resulting homogeneous networks are used to classify data either by network propositionalization or label propagation. We propose an adaptation of the label propagation algorithm to handle imbalanced data and test several classification algorithms in propositionalization. The new methodology is tested on three data sets with different properties. For each data set, we perform a series of experiments and compare different heuristics used in the first step of the methodology. We also use different classifiers which can be used in the second step of the methodology when performing network propositionalization. Our results show that HINMINE, using different network decomposition methods, can significantly improve the performance of the resulting classifiers, and also that using a modified label propagation algorithm is beneficial when the data set is imbalanced. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."},

The reason is that potentially large number of degrees of freedom have to be estimated for object localization and simplifications of the constellation topology are often assumed to make the inference tractable. We present a new formulation of the constellation model with correlation filters that treats the geometric and visual constraints within a single convex cost function and derive a highly efficient optimization for maximum a posteriori inference of a fully connected constellation. We propose a tracker that models the object at two levels of detail. The coarse level corresponds a root correlation filter and a novel color model for approximate object localization, while the mid-level representation is composed of the new deformable constellation of correlation filters that refine the object location. The resulting tracker is rigorously analyzed on a highly challenging OTB, VOT2014, and VOT2015 benchmarks, exhibits a state-of-the-art performance and runs in real-time. \u00a9 2013 IEEE."},

A major obstacle to applying data-driven methods in the programming domain is the lack of meaningful observable actions for describing the students problem-solving process. We propose rewrite rules as a language-independent formalization of programming actions in terms of code edits. We describe a method for automatically extracting rewrite rules from students program-writing traces, and a method for debugging new programs using these rules. We used these methods to automatically provide hints in a web application for learning programming. In-class evaluation showed that students receiving automatic feedback solved problems faster and submitted fewer incorrect programs. We believe that rewrite rules provide a good basis for further research into how humans write and debug programs. \u00a9 2008-2011 IEEE."},

While a target object's color distribution is reasonably motion-invariant, this is not true for the target's depth distribution, which continually varies as the target moves relative to the camera. It is therefore nontrivial to design target models which can fully exploit (potentially very rich) depth information for target tracking. For this reason, much of the previous RGB-D literature relies on color information for tracking, while exploiting depth information only for occlusion reasoning. In contrast, we propose an adaptive range-invariant target depth model, and show how both depth and color information can be fully and adaptively fused during the search for the target in each new RGB-D image. We introduce a new, hierarchical, two-layered target model (comprising local and global models) which uses spatio-temporal consistency constraints to achieve stable and robust on-the-fly target relearning. In the global layer, multiple features, derived from both color and depth data, are adaptively fused to find a candidate target region. In ambiguous frames, where one or more features disagree, this global candidate region is further decomposed into smaller local candidate regions for matching to local-layer models of small target parts. We also note that conventional use of depth data, for occlusion reasoning, can easily trigger false occlusion detections when the target moves rapidly toward the camera. To overcome this problem, we show how combining target information with contextual information enables the target's depth constraint to be relaxed. Our adaptively relaxed depth constraints can robustly accommodate large and rapid target motion in the depth direction, while still enabling the use of depth data for highly accurate reasoning about occlusions. For evaluation, we introduce a new RGB-D benchmark dataset with per-frame annotated attributes and extensive bias analysis. Our tracker is evaluated using two different state-of-the-art methodologies, VOT and object tracking benchmark, and in both cases it significantly outperforms four other state-of-the-art RGB-D trackers from the literature. \u00a9 2017 IEEE."},

Current state-of-the art detection methods can be roughly split into performance monitoring algorithms and distribution comparing algorithms. In this work we propose a novel concept drift detector that can be combined with an arbitrary classification algorithm. The proposed concept drift detector is based on computing multiple model explanations over time and observing the magnitudes of their changes. The model explanation is computed using a methodology that yields attribute-value contributions for prediction outcomes and thus provides insight into the model's decision-making process and enables its transparency. The evaluation has revealed that the methods surpass the baseline methods in terms of concept drift detection, accuracy, robustness and sensitivity. To even further augment interpretability, we visualized the detection of concept drift, enabling macro and micro views of the data. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd"},

It remains unknown whether the individual AMI subtypes reveal similar patterns. To date, generally seasonal variation in ST elevation MI (STEMI) has been investigated. However, these approaches couldn\u2019t detect the effects of changes in multiple meteorological variables on STEMI incidence within a specific season. Therefore, the aim of our study is to explore immediate, delayed and cumulative effects of average daily temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity on nation-wide STEMI hospital admissions. We linked daily hospitals\u2019 STEMI admission data with meteorological stations\u2019 data according to the patient\u2019s permanent residence. Subsequently, a multivariate analysis based on a main effect generalised linear model, assuming a log-link function with a Poisson distribution, was conducted. With the help of lags, we were able to analyse delayed effects, while the cumulative effects of specific meteorological variables were analysed utilising time windows. As a result, we confirmed immediate and delayed negative effect of low temperature and low relative humidity for all observed lags as well as cumulative average effects of low temperature and low relative humidity for all observed time windows. However, no delayed, single-day effect for atmospheric pressure was detected. Nevertheless, the cumulative average effect was confirmed in all time windows suggesting that prolonged low pressure influences the incidence of STEMI. A novelty of our approach is the comparative examination of immediate, delayed and cumulative effect of specific meteorological variables on the incidence of STEMI. This approach enables us to gain a new insight into the phenomenon studied. \u00a9 2017 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC."},

Such biometrics can be captured at public places from a distance without subjects collaboration, awareness and even consent. However, there are still numerous challenges caused by influence of covariate factors like changes of walking speed, view, clothing, footwear etc., that have negative impact on recognition performance. In this paper we tackle walking speed changes with a skeleton model-based gait recognition system focusing on improving algorithm robustness and improving the performance at higher walking speed changes. We achieve these by proposing frame based classification method, which overcomes the main shortcoming of distance based classification methods, which are very sensitive to gait cycle starting point detection. The proposed technique is starting point invariant with respect to gait cycle starts and as such ensures independence of classification from gait cycle start positions. Additionally, we propose wavelet transform based signal approximation, which enables the analysis of feature signals on different frequency space resolutions and diminishes the need for using feature transformation that require training. With the evaluation on OU-ISIR gait dataset we demonstrate state of the art performance of proposed methods. \u00a9 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."},

Burgdorf and Klep (J Oper Theory 68:141\u2013163, 2012) introduced its tracial analog, the truncated tracial moment problem, which replaces commuting variables with non-commuting ones and moments of \u03bc with tracial moments of matrices. In the bivariate quartic case, where indices run over words in two variables of degree at most four, every sequence with a positive definite 7 \u00d7 7 moment matrix M <sub>2</sub> can be represented with tracial moments (Burgdorf and Klep in C R Math Acad Sci Paris 348:721\u2013726, 2010, 2012). In this article the case of singular M <sub>2</sub> is studied. For M <sub>2</sub> of rank at most 5 the problem is solved completely; namely, concrete measures are obtained whenever they exist and the uniqueness question of the minimal measures is answered. For M <sub>2</sub> of rank 6 the problem splits into four cases, in two of which it is equivalent to the feasibility problem of certain linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the question of a flat extension of the moment matrix M <sub>2</sub> is addressed. While this is the most powerful tool for solving the classical case, it is shown here by examples that, while sufficient, flat extensions are mostly not a necessary condition for the existence of a measure in the tracial case. \u00a9 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."},

Both models produced good results, obtaining prediction accuracies of 0.88 and 0.86 when considering the list of five most likely diseases and 0.59 and 0.57 when considering only the most likely disease. The models did not differ significantly, which indicates that a reduced set of parameters can represent a relevant \"fingerprint\" of a disease.

A popular approach to ensure privacy protection in such data is the use of deidentification techniques, which aim at concealing the identity of individuals in the imagery while still preserving certain aspects of the data after deidentification. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards face deidentification, called k-Same-Net, which combines recent Generative Neural Networks (GNNs) with the well-known k-Anonymitymechanism and provides formal guarantees regarding privacy protection on a closed set of identities. Our GNN is able to generate synthetic surrogate face images for deidentification by seamlessly combining features of identities used to train the GNN model. Furthermore, it allows us to control the image-generation process with a small set of appearance-related parameters that can be used to alter specific aspects (e.g., facial expressions, age, gender) of the synthesized surrogate images. We demonstrate the feasibility of k-Same-Net in comprehensive experiments on the XM2VTS and CK+ datasets. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach through reidentification experiments with recent recognition models and compare our results with competing deidentification techniques from the literature. We also present facial expression recognition experiments to demonstrate the utility-preservation capabilities of k-Same-Net. Our experimental results suggest that k-Same-Net is a viable option for facial deidentification that exhibits several desirable characteristics when compared to existing solutions in this area. \u00a9 2018 by the authors."},

It is centrally placed on a cerebello-thalamo-cortical network connecting the primary motor cortex, to the dentate nucleus of the contralateral cerebellum through the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT). The VIM is not readily visible on conventional MR imaging, so identifying the surgical target traditionally involved indirect targeting that relies on atlas-defined coordinates. Unfortunately, this approach does not fully account for individual variability and requires surgery to be performed with the patient awake to allow for intraoperative targeting confirmation. The aim of this study is to identify the VIM and the DRT using probabilistic tractography in patients that will undergo thalamic DBS for tremor. Four male patients with tremor dominant PD and five patients (three female) with ET underwent high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) (128 diffusion directions, 1.5 mm isotropic voxels and b value = 1500) preoperatively. Patients received VIM-DBS using an MR image guided and MR image verified approach with indirect targeting. Postoperatively, using parallel Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) processing, thalamic areas with the highest diffusion connectivity to the primary motor area (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory area (S1) and contralateral dentate nucleus were identified. Additionally, volume of tissue activation (VTA) corresponding to active DBS contacts were modelled. Response to treatment was defined as 40% reduction in the total Fahn-Tolosa-Martin Tremor Rating Score (FTMTRS) with DBS-ON, one year from surgery. Three out of nine patients had a suboptimal, long-term response to treatment. The segmented thalamic areas corresponded well to anatomically known counterparts in the ventrolateral (VL) and ventroposterior (VP) thalamus. The dentate-thalamic area, lay within the M1-thalamic area in a ventral and lateral location. Streamlines corresponding to the DRT connected M1 to the contralateral dentate nucleus via the dentate-thalamic area, clearly crossing the midline in the mesencephalon. Good response was seen when the active contact VTA was in the thalamic area with highest connectivity to the contralateral dentate nucleus. Non-responders had active contact VTAs outside the dentate-thalamic area. We conclude that probabilistic tractography techniques can be used to segment the VL and VP thalamus based on cortical and cerebellar connectivity. The thalamic area, best representing the VIM, is connected to the contralateral dentate cerebellar nucleus. Connectivity based segmentation of the VIM can be achieved in individual patients in a clinically feasible timescale, using HARDI and high performance computing with parallel GPU processing. This same technique can map out the DRT tract with clear mesencephalic crossing. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)"},

These older than 70 years have significantly poorer prognosis than other patients and are considered a distinct group of glioblastoma patients. Modified prognostic factors are being used in these patients and this information is lately supplemented with the genetic and epigenetic information on tumour. The therapy is now often tailored accordingly. The aim of our study was to analyse the current treatment of the glioblastoma patients over 70 years of age to determine the impact of clinical prognostic factors. Among patients treated at the Institute of Oncology Ljubljana between 1997 and 2015, we found that 207 were older than 70 years. We analysed their survival, clinical prognostic factors (age, performance status) treatment modalities (extent of surgery, radiation dose, chemotherapy). Median survival of patients older than 70 years was 5.3 months which was statistically significant inferior to the survival of younger patients (p &lt; 0.001). The clinical prognostic factors that influenced survival the most were performance status (p &lt; 0.001), extent of surgical resection (p &lt; 0.001), addition of temozolomide (p &lt; 0.001) and addition of radiotherapy (p = 0.006). Patients receiving concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide, had same median survival as patients receiving adjuvant temozolomide after completion of radiotherapy. The increase of the number of older patients with glioblastoma corresponds to the increase in the life expectancy but in Slovenia also to the increased availability of diagnostic procedures. Clinical prognostic markers are helpful in decision on the aggressiveness of treatment. Radiotherapy and temozolomide have the biggest impact on survival, but the radiotherapy dose seems to be of secondary importance. In selected patients, chemotherapy alone might be sufficient to achieve an optimal effect. Patients that were fitter, had more aggressive surgery, and received temozolomide fared the best. The scheduling of the temozolomide seems to have limited impact on survival as in our study, there was no difference weather patients received temozolomide concomitant with radiotherapy or after the radiotherapy. Thus far, our findings corroborate the usefulness of recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) classes in clinical decisions. \u00a9 2018 Uros Smrdel, Marija Skoblar Vidmar, Ales Smrdel, published by Sciendo."},

It utilizes indoor architectural model and physical properties of wireless signal propagation through objects and space. The motivation for developing multiple frequency localization method lies in the future Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11ah) and the growing number of various wireless signals present in the buildings (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc.). Current indoor localization methods mostly rely on a single wireless signal type and often require many devices to achieve the necessary accuracy. MFAM utilizes multiple wireless signal types and improves the localization accuracy over the usage of a single frequency. It continuously monitors signal propagation through space and adapts the model according to the changes indoors. Using multiple signal sources lowers the required number of access points for a specific signal type while utilizing signals, already present in the indoors. Due to the unavailability of the 802.11ah hardware, we have evaluated proposed method with similar signals; we have used 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and 868 MHz HomeMatic home automation signals. We have performed the evaluation in a modern two-bedroom apartment and measured mean localization error 2.0 to 2.3 m and median error of 2.0 to 2.2 m. Based on our evaluation results, using two different signals improves the localization accuracy by 18% in comparison to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi-only approach.

Several myomiRs have shown promise for therapeutic use in cellular and animal models of ALS; however, the exact miRNA species differentially expressed in muscle tissue of ALS patients remain unknown. Following small RNA-Seq, we compared the expression of small RNAs in muscle tissue of ALS patients and healthy age-matched controls. The identified snoRNAs, mtRNAs and other small RNAs provide possible molecular links between insulin signaling and ALS. Furthermore, the identified miRNAs are predicted to target proteins that are involved in both normal processes and various muscle disorders and indicate muscle tissue is undergoing active reinnervation/compensatory attempts thus providing targets for further research and therapy development in ALS. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."},

The approach operates by combining different local cyclicity estimators and sensor channels, and can additionally employ a priori knowledge on the fiducial points of gait events. The approach is universal as it can work on signals acquired by different inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor types, is template-free, and operates unsupervised. A thorough evaluation was performed with two datasets: our own collected FRIgait dataset available for open use, containing long-term inertial measurements collected from 57 subjects using smartphones within the span of more than one year, and an FAU eGait dataset containing inertial data from shoe-mounted sensors collected from three cohorts of subjects: healthy, geriatric, and Parkinson\u2019s disease patients. The evaluation was performed in controlled and uncontrolled conditions. When compared to the ground truth of the labelled FRIgait and eGait datasets, the results of our evaluation revealed the high robustness, efficiency (F-measure of about 98%), and accuracy (mean absolute error MAE in about the range of one sample) of the proposed approach. Based on these results, we conclude that the proposed approach shows great potential for its applicability in procedures and algorithms for movement analysis. \u00a9 2018 by the authors.

Over 1,000 genes are differentially expressed between sexes indicating that female and male livers are two metabolically distinct organs. The spectrum of liver diseases is broad and is usually prevalent in one or the other sex, with different contributing genetic and environmental factors. It is thus difficult to predict individual's disease outcomes and treatment options. Systems approaches including mathematical modeling can aid importantly in understanding the multifactorial liver disease etiology leading toward tailored diagnostics, prognostics and therapy. The currently established computational models of hepatic metabolism that have proven to be essential for understanding of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited to the description of gender-independent response or reflect solely the response of the males. Herein we present LiverSex, the first sex-based multi-tissue and multi-level liver metabolic computational model. The model was constructed based on in silico liver model SteatoNet and the object-oriented modeling. The crucial factor in adaptation of liver metabolism to the sex is the inclusion of estrogen and androgen receptor responses to respective hormones and the link to sex-differences in growth hormone release. The model was extensively validated on literature data and experimental data obtained from wild type C57BL/6 mice fed with regular chow and western diet. These experimental results show extensive sex-dependent changes and could not be reproduced in silico with the uniform model SteatoNet. LiverSex represents the first large-scale liver metabolic model, which allows a detailed insight into the sex-dependent complex liver pathologies, and how the genetic and environmental factors interact with the sex in disease appearance and progression. We used the model to identify the most important sex-dependent metabolic pathways, which are involved in accumulation of triglycerides representing initial steps of NAFLD. We identified PGC1A, PPARa, FXR, and LXR as regulatory factors that could become important in sex-dependent personalized treatment of NAFLD. \u00a9 2018 Cvitanovic Toma\u0161, Urlep, Mo\u0161kon, Mraz and Rozman."},

In biometric recognition systems the detection of the region-of-interest (ROI) is one of the most crucial steps in the processing pipeline, significantly impacting the performance of the entire recognition system. Existing approaches to ear detection, are commonly susceptible to the presence of severe occlusions, ear accessories or variable illumination conditions and often deteriorate in their performance if applied on ear images captured in unconstrained settings. To address these shortcomings, we present a novel ear detection technique based on convolutional encoder-decoder networks (CEDs). We formulate the problem of ear detection as a two-class segmentation problem and design and train a CED-network architecture to distinguish between imagepixels belonging to the ear and the non-ear class. Unlike competing techniques, our approach does not simply return a bounding box around the detected ear, but provides detailed, pixel-wise information about the location of the ears in the image. Experiments on a dataset gathered from the web (a.k.a. in the wild) show that the proposed technique ensures good detection results in the presence of various covariate factors and significantly outperforms competing methods from the literature. \u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2018."},

In this paper, a criterion for the optimal printout of the left parse is defined regarding the interleaving of parser actions and printout of individual productions comprising the resulting left parse. In some cases, parsing cannot be done at all without at least some semantic rule evaluation, while in most cases interleaving of parsing and semantic rule evaluation can significantly improve error recovery and the quality of error messages. Finally, the criterion is applied to some of the most important contemporary parsing algorithms.

Humans and animals have an ability to control the decision threshold, that is, the amount of evidence that needs to be gathered to commit to a choice, and it has been proposed that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is important for this control. Recent behavioral and neurophysiological data suggest that, in some circumstances, the decision threshold decreases with time during choice trials, allowing overcoming of indecision during difficult choices. Here we asked whether this within-trial decrease of the decision threshold is mediated by the STN and if it is affected by disrupting information processing in the STN through deep brain stimulation (DBS). We assessed 13 patients with Parkinson disease receiving bilateral STN DBS six or more months after the surgery, 11 age-matched controls, and 12 young healthy controls. All participants completed a series of decision trials, in which the evidence was presented in discrete time points, which allowed more direct estimation of the decision threshold. The participants differed widely in the slope of their decision threshold, ranging from constant threshold within a trial to steeply decreasing. However, the slope of the decision threshold did not depend on whether STN DBS was switched on or off and did not differ between the patients and controls. Furthermore, there was no difference in accuracy and RT between the patients in the on and off stimulation conditions and healthy controls. Previous studies that have reported modulation of the decision threshold by STN DBS or unilateral subthalamotomy in Parkinson disease have involved either fast decision-making under conflict or time pressure or in anticipation of high reward. Our findings suggest that, in the absence of reward, decision conflict, or time pressure for decision-making, the STN does not play a critical role in modulating the within-trial decrease of decision thresholds during the choice process. \u00a9 2018 Massachusetts Institute of Technology."},

We show that convexity is an inherent property of many networks that is not present in a random graph. Most convex are spatial infrastructure networks and social collaboration graphs due to their tree-like or clique-like structure, whereas the food web is the only network studied that is truly non-convex. Core-periphery networks are regionally convex as they can be divided into a non-convex core surrounded by a convex periphery.

Objective: To investigate the acute effects of various STN-DBS frequencies (40-160 Hz, 40 Hz intervals) on upper limb motor function. Methods: We carried out a randomised, double-blind study on 20 PD patients with chronic STN-DBS using the Simple and Assembly components of the Purdue Pegboard (PP) test and a modified upper limb version of the UPDRS-III (UL-UPDRS-III). Results: There was no significant effect of frequency on bradykinesia on the Simple PP task or the UL-UPDRS-III. There was an effect of frequency on the Assembly PP score when comparing all frequencies (p = 0.019) and between 80 Hz and 130 Hz (p = 0.007), with lower frequencies yielding a better performance. Rigidity and Tremor scores were significantly reduced with higher (80 Hz) compared to lower (40 Hz) frequencies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a wide range of frequencies are efficacious in improving acute upper-limb motor function. Reducing the frequency of stimulation down to 80 Hz is safe and has a similar clinical effect to higher frequencies. Therefore, a wider range of frequencies are available when it comes adjusting patients' acute settings without the risk of worsening bradykinesia. \u00a9 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

Having a list of frequent errors, a teacher can prepare common feedback to all students that explains the difficult concepts. We present the problem as supervised rule learning, where each rule corresponds to a specific approach or error. We use correct and incorrect submitted programs as the learning examples, where patterns in abstract syntax trees are used as attributes. As the space of all possible patterns is immense, we needed the help of experts to select relevant patterns. To elicit knowledge from the experts, we used the argument-based machine learning (ABML) method, in which an expert and ABML interactively exchange arguments until the model is good enough. We provide a step-by-step demonstration of the ABML process, present examples of ABML questions and corresponding expert's answers, and interpret some of the induced rules.

Introduction of a unified orchestration platform would solve these issues, as it would deliver a common vocabulary for different types of workflow designers and would provide them with a single platform for orchestrating both business and technical activities, without having to face the integration complexities. The main objective of this paper is to provide support for cloud-specific workflows in BPMN business process engines. To achieve this objective we (1) define a meta-model for modeling cloud workflows, (2) extend BPMN 2.0.2 specification to orchestrate cloud-specific workflow activities, and (3) implement a meta-model with BPMN extensions by showing how cloud orchestration workflow elements (i.e. activities and workflow control) map onto extended BPMN elements. As a part of the evaluation we measure process size and complexity of two process models using various process metrics. The results have shown that when using our proposed BPMN extensions, the overall size and complexity of the use case process under test has been reduced by more than half on an average. We also improve the readability of BPMN process. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd"},

To study this influence, data were collected through a questionnaire, semi-structured interviews, and a focus-group discussion from 15 long-term migrants (university language teachers) and eight mid-term migrants (teachers at two international schools) working in Slovenia. The results show that the long-term migrants all learned the host language, while the most common mediation strategy of the mid-term migrants was use of a lingua franca. Ad-hoc interpreters and translators were used not only in healthcare but also for the translations of official documents. Moreover, the French-speaking mid-term migrants attempted to learn the host language and often ended up learning English, while the group of native English speakers tended to form a linguistic enclave. It is argued that the preferred mediation strategy depends not just on the intended length of stay but also on the status of the migrant's L1 in the particular host country. \u00a9 John Benjamins Publishing Company."},

We examined air pollutant trends (PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>) in Slovenia, where in the past the main issue were SO<sub>2</sub> levels. Now, the population is still exposed to PM<sub>10</sub> and ozone levels that are above the recommended levels. Our goal was to assess if the levels of air pollutants were decreasing from 2002 to 2017 due to emission ceilings or were more influenced by changes in the meteorological situation. We modelled the relationship between levels, meteorological parameters, and seasonality and then used the models with the best estimated generalisation to adjust levels for meteorology. Models showed a significant relationship between meteorological parameters and PM<sub>10</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub> levels, but not SO<sub>2</sub>. We analysed trends of raw and adjusted levels and compared them. Trends of PM<sub>10</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> were decreasing at all locations for raw and adjusted data. The largest decrease was observed in SO<sub>2</sub> levels where the largest decrease in emissions occurred. Trends of NO<sub>2</sub> were also significant and negative at most locations. Levels of O<sub>3</sub> did not exhibit a significant trend at most locations. Results show that changes in the meteorological situation affected PM<sub>10</sub> levels the most, especially where the entire period (2002\u20132017) could be observed. There is strong empirical evidence that changes in meteorological parameters contributed to the decrease in PM<sub>10</sub> levels while the decrease in NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> levels can be attributed to emission ceilings. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd"},

Multiple health care, academic communities, such as information seeking and dissemination and persuasive technologies, acknowledge this need. However, in order to obtain understanding, a relevant way to model online communication for the study of behavior is required. In this paper, we propose an automatic method to reveal process models of interrelated speech intentions from conversations. Specifically, a domain-independent taxonomy of speech intentions is adopted, an annotated corpus of Reddit conversations is released, supervised classifiers for speech intention prediction from utterances are trained and assessed using 10-fold cross validation (multi-class, one-versus-all and multi-label setups) and an approach to transform conversations into well-defined, representative logs of verbal behavior, needed by process mining techniques, is designed. The experimental results show that: (1) the automatic classification of intentions is feasible (with Kappa scores varying between 0.52 and 1); (2) predicting pairs of intentions, also known as adjacency pairs, or including more utterances from even other heterogeneous corpora can improve the predictions of some classes; and (3) the classifiers in the current state are robust to be used on other corpora, although the results are poorer and suggest that the input corpus may not sufficiently capture varied ways of expressing certain speech intentions. The extracted process models of interrelated speech intentions open new views on grasping the formation of beliefs and behavioral intentions in and from speech, but in-depth evaluation of these conversational models is further required. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V."},

In both cases, the collection and selection of proper articles are crucial. Due to a lot of available articles from different sources and its diverse quality, a lot of tedious (often manual) work is required.

The framework supports visualization of volumetric data, such as 3D scalar fields acquired by a CT, MRI or PET scanners. To improve users' perception, understanding and manipulation of 3D volumes, we adapted the traditional 2D screen representation with support for visualization of data in a VR environment. By providing complete visual immersion, VR can help users to gain better insights and understanding of the visualized data. Our main goal was to allow users to view the medical data in VR and interact with it with hand-held controllers for better immersion and spatial perception. In the paper, we present a novel approach to implementation of VR for medical imaging, which combines WebGL-based hardware accelerated web visualization with VR. This allows users to use the visualization framework with or without a VR headset by switching between 'standard' and 'VR' modes. Since visualization runs in a web browser, it is portable, easy to use on different devices and therefore accessible to a broad number of users.

We propose a sensor node for monitoring of indoor ambient noise. The sensor node is based on a hardware platform with limited computational resources and utilizes several simplifications to approximate more complex and costly signal processing stage. Furthermore, to reduce the communication between the sensor node and a sink node, as well as the power consumed by the IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) transceiver, we perform digital A-weighting filtering and non-calibrated calculation of the sound pressure level on the node. According to experimental results, the proposed sound level meter can accurately measure the noise levels of up to 100 dB, with the mean difference of less than 2 dB compared to Class 1 sound level meter. The proposed device can continuously monitor indoor noise for several days.

They are usually diagnosed using ECG recordings, particularly long ambulatory recordings (AECG). These recordings are tedious to interpret by humans due to their extent (up to 48 h) and the relative scarcity of arrhythmia events. This makes automated systems for detecting various AECG anomalies indispensable. In this work we present a novel procedure based on topological principles (Morse theory) for detecting arrhythmic beats in AECG. It works in nearly real-time (delayed by a 14 s window), and can be applied to raw (unprocessed) ECG signals. Methods: The procedure is based on a subject-specific adaptation of the one-dimensional discrete Morse theory (ADMT), which represents the signal as a sequence of its most important extrema. The ADMT algorithm is applied twice; for low-amplitude, high-frequency noise removal, and for detection of the characteristic waves of individual ECG beats. The waves are annotated using the ADMT algorithm and template matching. The annotated beats are then compared to the adjacent beats with two measures of similarity: the distance between two beats, and the difference in shape between them. The two measures of similarity are used as inputs to a decision tree algorithm that classifies the beats as normal or abnormal. The classification performance is evaluated with the leave-one-record-out cross-validation method. Results: Our approach was tested on the MIT-BIH database, where it exhibited a classification accuracy of 92.73%, a sensitivity of 73.35%, a specificity of 96.70%, a positive predictive value of 88.01%, and a negative predictive value of 95.73%. Conclusions: Compared to related studies, our algorithm requires less preprocessing while retaining the capability to detect and classify beats in almost real-time. The algorithm exhibits a high degree of accuracy in beats detection and classification that are at least comparable to state-of-the-art methods. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier B.V."},

The results reveal specifics of each social media, which to some extent also depend on the data available and the selected seed keywords. We uncover that popularity of selected topics in social media is proportional to the number of hits on Google, celebrities and politicians are the most talked topics and that behaviour of users across social media is different. For example, Twitter users prefer to post more, while Facebook and Youtube users prefer to comment. The majority of all social media posts are in English, larger number of them are negative and often written by male users.

The key idea is to base medical decisions on individual patient characteristics, including molecular and behavioral biomarkers, rather than on population averages. Personalized medicine is deeply connected to and dependent on data science, specifically machine learning (often named Artificial Intelligence in the mainstream media). While during recent years there has been a lot of enthusiasm about the potential of 'big data' and machine learning-based solutions, there exist only few examples that impact current clinical practice. The lack of impact on clinical practice can largely be attributed to insufficient performance of predictive models, difficulties to interpret complex model predictions, and lack of validation via prospective clinical trials that demonstrate a clear benefit compared to the standard of care. In this paper, we review the potential of state-of-the-art data science approaches for personalized medicine, discuss open challenges, and highlight directions that may help to overcome them in the future. Conclusions: There is a need for an interdisciplinary effort, including data scientists, physicians, patient advocates, regulatory agencies, and health insurance organizations.

Current researches are based on the analysis of ElectroHysteroGram (EHG) records, which contain information about the electrophysiological properties of the uterine muscle and uterine contractions. Since pregnancy is a long process, we decided to also characterize, for the first time, non-contraction intervals (dummy intervals) of the uterine records, i.e., EHG signals accompanied by a simultaneously recorded external tocogram measuring mechanical uterine activity (TOCO signal). For this purpose, we developed a new set of uterine records, TPEHGT DS, containing preterm and term uterine records of pregnant women, and uterine records of non-pregnant women. We quantitatively characterized contraction intervals (contractions) and dummy intervals of the uterine records of the TPEHGT DS in terms of the normalized power spectra of the EHG and TOCO signals, and developed a new method for predicting preterm birth. The results on the characterization revealed that the peak amplitudes of the normalized power spectra of the EHG and TOCO signals of the contraction and dummy intervals in the frequency band 1.0-2.2 Hz, describing the electrical and mechanical activity of the uterus due to the maternal heart (maternal heart rate), are high only during term pregnancies, when the delivery is still far away; and they are low when the delivery is close. However, these peak amplitudes are also low during preterm pregnancies, when the delivery is still supposed to be far away (thus suggesting the danger of preterm birth); and they are also low or barely present for non-pregnant women. We propose the values of the peak amplitudes of the normalized power spectra due to the influence of the maternal heart, in an elec-tro-mechanical sense, in the frequency band 1.0-2.2 Hz as a new biophysical marker for the preliminary, or early, assessment of the danger of preterm birth. The classification of preterm and term, contraction and dummy intervals of the TPEHGT DS, for the task of the automatic prediction of preterm birth, using sample entropy, the median frequency of the power spectra, and the peak amplitude of the normalized power spectra, revealed that the dummy intervals provide quite comparable and slightly higher classification performances than these features obtained from the contraction intervals. This result suggests a novel and simple clinical technique, not necessarily to seek contraction intervals but using the dummy intervals, for the early assessment of the danger of preterm birth. Using the publicly available TPEHG DB database to predict preterm birth in terms of classifying between preterm and term EHG records, the proposed method outperformed all currently existing methods. The achieved classification accuracy was 100% for early records, recorded around the 23rd week of pregnancy; and 96.33%, the area under the curve of 99.44%, for all records of the database. Since the proposed method is capable of using the dummy intervals with high classification accuracy, it is also suitable for clinical use very early during pregnancy, around the 23rd week of pregnancy, when contractions may or may not be present. \u00a9 2018 Jager et al.

Our study is based on high quality data about (1) research projects awarded in Slovenia in the period 1994\u20132016 (7508 projects with 2725 PI\u2019s in total) and (2) about scientific productivity of all researchers in Slovenia that were active in the period 1970\u20132016\u2014there are 19,598 such researchers in total, including the PI\u2019s. We compare average productivity, collaboration, internationality and interdisciplinarity of PI\u2019s and of all active researchers. Our analysis shows that for all four indicators the average performance of PI\u2019s is much higher compared to average performance of all active researchers. Additionally, we analyze careers of both groups of researchers. The results show that the PI\u2019s have on average longer and more fruitful career compared to all active researchers, with regards to all career indicators. The PI\u2019s that have received a postdoc grant have at the beginning outstanding scientific performance, but later deviate towards average. On long run, the PI\u2019s leading the research programs (the most prestigious grants) on average demonstrate the best scientific performance. In the last part of the paper we study 23 co-authorship networks, spanned by all active researchers in the periods 1970\u20131994,\u00a0..,\u00a01970\u20132016. We find out that they are well connected and that PI\u2019s are well distributed across these networks forming their backbones. Even more, PI\u2019s generate new PI\u2019s, since more than 90% of new PI\u2019s are connected (have at least one joint scientific publication) with existing PI\u2019s. We believe that our study sheds new light to the relations between the public funding of the science and the scientific output and can be considered as an affirmative answer to the question posed in the title. \u00a9 2018, Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3, Budapest, Hungary."},

A fully convex network would therefore be a collection of cliques stitched together in a tree. In this paper, we study the largest high-convexity part of empirical networks obtained by removing the least number of edges, which we call a convex skeleton. A convex skeleton is a generalization of a network spanning tree in which each edge can be replaced by a clique of arbitrary size. We present different approaches for extracting convex skeletons and apply them to social collaboration and protein interactions networks, autonomous systems graphs and food webs. We show that the extracted convex skeletons retain the degree distribution, clustering, connectivity, distances, node position and also community structure, while making the shortest paths between the nodes largely unique. Moreover, in the Slovenian computer scientists coauthorship network, a convex skeleton retains the strongest ties between the authors, differently from a spanning tree or high-betweenness backbone and high-salience skeleton. A convex skeleton thus represents a simple definition of a network backbone with applications in coauthorship and other social collaboration networks. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Automated systems are used in combination with human graders in different high-stake assessments, where grading models are learned on essays datasets scored by different graders. Despite the unified grading rules, human graders can unintentionally introduce subjective bias into scores. Consequently, a grading model has to learn from a data that represents a noisy relationship between essay attributes and its grade.

Since measurements are prone to errors, approaches dealing with uncertain data are especially suitable for this task. Fuzzy models are one such approach, but they contain a large amount of parameters and are thus susceptible to over-fitting. Validation methods that help detect over-fitting are therefore needed to eliminate inaccurate models. Results: We propose a method to enlarge the validation datasets on which a fuzzy dynamic model of a cellular network can be tested. We apply our method to two data-driven dynamic models of the MAPK signalling pathway and two models of the mammalian circadian clock. We show that random initial state perturbations can drastically increase the mean error of predictions of an inaccurate computational model, while keeping errors of predictions of accurate models small. Conclusions: With the improvement of validation methods, fuzzy models are becoming more accurate and are thus likely to gain new applications. This field of research is promising not only because fuzzy models can cope with uncertainty, but also because their run time is short compared to conventional modelling methods that are nowadays used in systems biology. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."},

With a marked increase of jellyfish populations worldwide, understanding the dynamics of the polyp (scyphistoma) stage of their life-cycle is becoming increasingly important. In-situ studies of polyp population dynamics are scarce due to small size of the polyps and tedious manual work required to annotate and count large numbers of items in underwater photographs. We devised an experiment which shows a large variance between human annotators, as well as in annotations made by the same annotator. We have tackled this problem, which is present in many areas of marine biology, by developing a method for automated detection and counting. Our polyp counter (PoCo) uses a two-stage approach with a fast detector (Aggregated Channel Features) and a precise classifier consisting of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network and a Support Vector Machine. PoCo was tested on a year-long image dataset and performed with accuracy comparable to human annotators but with 70-fold reduction in time. The algorithm can be used in many marine biology applications, vastly reducing the amount of manual labor and enabling processing of much larger datasets.

One of the most important issues stopping ear recognition systems from being widely available are ear occlusions and accessories. Ear accessories not only mask biometric features and by this reduce the overall recognition performance, but also introduce new non-biometric features that can be exploited for spoofing purposes. Ignoring ear accessories during recognition can, therefore, present a security threat to ear recognition and also adversely affect performance. Despite the importance of this topic there has been, to the best of our knowledge, no ear recognition studies that would address these problems. In this work we try to close this gap and study the impact of ear accessories on the recognition performance of several state-of-the-art ear recognition techniques. We consider ear accessories as a tool for spoofing attacks and show that CNN-based recognition approaches are more susceptible to spoofing attacks than traditional descriptor-based approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using inpainting techniques or average coloring can mitigate the problems caused by ear accessories and slightly outperforms (standard) black color to mask ear accessories. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."},

We evaluate the model on the Multi-Angle Sclera Database (MASD) dataset and describe comprehensive experiments focusing on: i) segmentation performance, ii) error analysis, iii) the sensitivity of the model to changes in view direction, and iv) comparisons with competing single-class techniques.

This paper revisits two convolutional neural network (CNN) models based on VGG16, multi-structure region of interest (MS-ROI) and class activation map (CAM), which enable the localization of salient image regions. While the MS-ROI model allows for the localization of multiple salient image regions, the CAM model, on the other hand, tends to localize only the most relevant class. We use the contextual information provided by the obtained saliency maps to guide the compression. By encoding more important image regions at a higher bitrate and less important ones at a lower bitrate, different qualities of compression for the regions of interest and the background are obtained, while also achieving smooth transitions from salient to non-salient regions. The performance of both models is evaluated on images from the MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset and the General-100 dataset, and the results of the compression are compared to the standard JPEG compression at different quality factors. Experimental results show that for the files of approximately same size, the compression methods based on the two CNN models outperform the standard JPEG compression. When comparing the compression based on the MS-ROI model to the compression based on the CAM model, the former is characterized by a higher PSNR and a better visual quality of the obtained images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE."},

However, evidence from case series or uncontrolled studies suggests that it may lead in some patients to specific parkinsonian symptoms such as freezing of gait, micrographia, and bradykinesia. We investigated parkinsonian signs using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score by means of observer-blinded video ratings in a group of 29 patients treated with pallidal stimulation and a non-surgical control group of 22 patients, both with predominant cervical dystonia. Additional assessments included MRI-based models of volume of neural tissue activated to investigate areas of stimulation related to dystonic symptom control and those likely to induce parkinsonian signs as well as an EMG analysis to investigate functional vicinity of stimulation fields to the pyramidal tract. Compared with controls, stimulated patients had significantly higher motor scores (median, 25th-75th percentile: 14.0, 8.0-19.5 versus 3.0, 2.0-8.0; P &lt; 0.0001), as well as bradykinesia (8.0, 6.0-14.0 versus 2.0, 0.0-3.0; P &lt; 0.0001) and axial motor subscores (2.0, 1.0-4.0 versus 0.0, 0.0-1.0; P = 0.0002), while rigidity and tremor subscores were not different between groups. Parkinsonian signs were partially reversible upon switching stimulation off for a median of 90 min in a subset of 19 patients tolerating this condition. Furthermore, the stimulation group reported more features of freezing of gait on a questionnaire basis. Quality of life was better in stimulated patients compared with control patients, but parkinsonian signs were negatively associated with quality of life. In the descriptive imaging analysis maximum efficacy for dystonia improvement projected to the posteroventrolateral internal pallidum with overlapping clusters driving severity of bradykinesia and axial motor symptoms. The severities of parkinsonian signs were not correlated with functional vicinity to the pyramidal tract as assessed by EMG. In conclusion, parkinsonian signs, particularly bradykinesia and axial motor signs, due to pallidal stimulation in dystonic patients are frequent and negatively impact on motor functioning and quality of life. Therefore, patients with pallidal stimulation should be monitored closely for such signs both in clinical routine and future clinical trials. Spread of current outside the internal pallidum is an unlikely explanation for this phenomenon, which seems to be caused by stimulation of neural elements within the stimulation target volume. \u00a9 2018 The Author(s)."},

The concept of integration of applications and systems is a cloud integration platform where applications and systems do not integrate directly, but through a cloud integration platform based on a standard defined in the project.

However, the problem is NP-complete, and the search efficiency may also be negatively affected by symmetries in the pattern graph. In this paper, we present an algorithm for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem using a search plan, a sequence of instructions for a systematic traversal of the pattern graph. The presented algorithm pays attention to the symmetries in the pattern graph and thus performs more efficiently than its straightforward counterpart which merely follows the search plan instructions in all possible ways. By testing our algorithm on artificial and real-world graphs, we empirically confirm its advantage over the naive approach and answer several research questions. \u00a9 2018 Electrotechnical Society of Slovenia.

However, the node mobility and efficient cross-layer communication between the overlay and MANET routing protocols remains a challenge for reliable data transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel Mobility Aware Cross-layer Routing approach for Peer-to-Peer Networks (MACARON) over MANET. MACARON provides reliable communication and high lifetime routes to support efficient data transmission in the network. For this purpose, it uses cross-layer communications to share routing updates between MANET and overlay routing protocols. MACARON provides guaranteed routes with low path stretch by maintaining O\u02dc(n) routing entries per node, where n is the number of nodes in the network. It provides scalability without using any landmark directory to store routing state, and it can effectively handle moderate mobility by using Last Encounter Routing (LER) protocol. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd"},

It can be measured on the scale [0, 1] with 1 being assigned to fully convex networks. The largest convex component of a graph that emerges after the removal of the least number of edges is called a convex skeleton. It is basically a tree of cliques, which has been shown to have many interesting features. In this article the notions of convexity and convex skeletons in the context of scientific collaboration networks are discussed. More specifically, we analyze the co-authorship networks of Slovenian researchers in computer science, physics, sociology, mathematics, and economics and extract convex skeletons from them. We then compare these convex skeletons with the residual graphs (remainders) in terms of collaboration frequency distributions by various parameters such as the publication year and type, co-authors' birth year, status, gender, discipline, etc. We also show the top-ranked scientists by four basic centrality measures as calculated on the original networks and their skeletons and conclude that convex skeletons may help detect influential scholars that are hardly identifiable in the original collaboration network. As their inherent feature, convex skeletons retain the properties of collaboration networks. These include high-level structural properties but also the fact that the same authors are highlighted by centrality measures. Moreover, the most important ties and thus the most important collaborations are retained in the skeletons. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."},

This is characterised by a tonic forward sway response that is reportedly diminished or absent in patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia. Objective: To investigating the impact of the sensory trick on vibration-induced postural responses. Methods: 20 patients with idiopathic cervical dystonia and a sensory trick, 15 patients without a trick, and 16 healthy controls were recruited. Neck muscle vibration was applied bilaterally over the upper trapezius under three different conditions: 1) Quiet standing; 2) standing while performing the trick (or trick-like movement in non-responders); 3) standing while elevating the flexed arm without touching any part of the body. Centre of pressure position and whole-body orientation in the sagittal plane were analysed. Results: Patients with a sensory trick responded similarly to healthy controls: neck muscle vibration led to an initial forward sway of the body that slowly increased during the prolonged vibration for all three conditions. This response was mainly mediated by ankle flexion. In patients without a trick, the initial sagittal sway was significantly reduced in all three conditions and the later slow increase was absent. Performance of the trick did not have an effect on any aspect of the response in either cervical dystonia group. Conclusions: The whole-body response to neck vibration in cervical dystonia differs depending on the effectiveness of the sensory trick to alleviate the dystonic neck posture. Variable pathophysiology of proprioceptive processing may be the common factor. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd"},

The use of IT has the potential to be the major driver for success, as well it provides an opportunity to achieve competitive advantage and support digital transformation. In order to achieve IT benefits, enterprises need an effective and successful ITG model, which follows and adapts to business needs. Available ITG models are too generic and do not differentiate for enterprises of different industry, size, maturity etc. Methodology: In order to review existing ITG mechanisms, their definitions and identify contingency factors, we performed an extensive literature review (LR). For the initial set of databases, we used the list of journals, which are indexed in the Journal Citation Reports. We also used Web of Science to identify articles with the highest number of citations. Results: This paper provides the most important definitions of ITG and proposes its comprehensive definition. Next to this, we introduce ITG mechanisms, which are crucial for the effective implementation and use of ITG. Lastly, we identify contingency factors that influence ITG implementation and its use.

Multiple efforts to develop methods for governing IT failed to achieve any significant adoption rate of ITG mechanisms. To enable ITG to become an integral part of Corporate Governance, further research needs to focus on the development of an adaptive strategic ITG model.

The expected workload, Quality of Service (QoS) and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) must be considered before an appropriate infrastructure is selected. However, this decision-making process is complex and time-consuming. Moreover, the software engineer needs assurances that the selected infrastructure will lead to an adequate QoS of the application. Objective: The goal is to develop a new method for selection of an optimal cloud deployment option, that is, an infrastructure and configuration for deployment and to verify that all hard and as many soft QoS requirements as possible will be met at runtime. Method: A new Formal QoS Assurances Method (FoQoSAM), which relies on stochastic Markov models is introduced to facilitate an automated decision-making process. For a given workload, it uses QoS monitoring data and a user-related metric in order to automatically generate a probabilistic model. The probabilistic model takes the form of a finite automaton. It is further used to produce a rank list of cloud deployment options. As a result, any of the cloud deployment options can be verified by applying a probabilistic model checking approach. Results: Testing was performed by ranking deployment options for two cloud applications, File Upload and Video-conferencing. The FoQoSAM method was compared to a baseline Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results show that the first ranked cloud deployment options satisfy all hard and at least one of the soft requirements for both methods, however, the FoQoSAM method always satisfies at least an additional QoS requirement compared to the baseline AHP method. Conclusions: The proposed new FoQoSAM method is appropriate and can be used in decision-making when ranking and verifying cloud deployment options. Due to its practical utility it was integrated into the SWITCH workbench. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V."},

In particular, RBMXL2 represses the selection of aberrant splice sites and the insertion of cryptic and premature terminal exons. Our data suggest a Rbmxl2 retrogene has been conserved across mammals as part of a splicing control mechanism that is fundamentally important to germ cell biology. We propose that this mechanism is essential to meiosis because it buffers the high ambient concentrations of splicing activators, thereby preventing poisoning of key transcripts and disruption to gene expression by aberrant splice site selection. \u00a9 2019, Ehrmann et al."},

We present a segmentation method that segments field recordings into individual units labelled as speech, solo singing, choir singing, and instrumentals. Classification is based on convolutional deep networks, and is augmented with a probabilistic approach for segmentation. We describe the dataset gathered for the task and the tools developed for gathering the reference annotations.

Speech intelligibility (SI) and verbal fluency (VF) have been shown to deteriorate following chronic STN-DBS. It has been suggested that speech might respond favourably to low frequency stimulation (LFS). Objective: We examined how SI, perceptual speech characteristics, phonemic and semantic VF and processes underlying it (clustering and switching) respond to LFS of 60 and 80 Hz in comparison to high frequency stimulation (HFS) (110, 130 and 200 Hz). Methods: In this double-blind study, 15 STN-DBS PD patients (mean age 65, SD = 5.8, 14 right handed, three females), were assessed at five stimulation frequencies: 60 Hz, 80 Hz, 110 Hz, 130 Hz and 200 Hz. In addition to the clinical neurological assessment of speech, VF and SI were assessed. Results: SI and in particular articulation, respiration, phonation and prosody improved with LFS (all p &lt; 0.05). Phonemic VF switching improved with LFS (p = 0.005) but this did not translate to an improved phonemic VF score. A trend for improved semantic VF was found. A negative correlation was found between perceptual characteristics of speech and duration of chronic stimulation (all p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for meticulous programming of frequency to maximise SI in chronic STNDBS. The findings further implicate stimulation frequency in changes to specific processes underlying VF, namely phonemic switching and demonstrate the potential to address such deficits through advanced adjustment of stimulation parameters. \u00a9 2019 IOS Press and the authors.

As such, genetic variability in these pathways could have a role in susceptibility for the disease as well as in the treatment outcome. Dopaminergic treatment is effective in management of motor symptoms, but poses a risk for motor and non-motor adverse events. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress on Parkinson's disease susceptibility and the occurrence of adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. Methods: In total, 224 patients were enrolled, and their demographic and clinical data on the disease course were collected. Furthermore, a control group of 146 healthy Slovenian blood donors were included for Parkinson's disease' risk evaluation. Peripheral blood was obtained for DNA isolation. Genotyping was performed for NLRP3 rs35829419, CARD8 rs2043211, IL1\u03b2 rs16944, IL1\u03b2 rs1143623, IL6 rs1800795, CAT rs1001179, CAT rs10836235, SOD2 rs4880, NOS1 rs2293054, NOS1 rs2682826, TNF-\u03b1 rs1800629, and GPX1 rs1050450. Logistic regression was used for analysis of possible associations. Results: We observed a nominally significant association of the IL1\u03b2 rs1143623 C allele with the risk for Parkinson's disease (OR = 0.59; 95%CI = 0.38-0.92, p = 0.021). CAT rs1001179 A allele was significantly associated with peripheral edema (OR = 0.32; 95%CI = 0.15-0.68; p = 0.003). Other associations observed were only nominally significant after adjustments: NOS1 rs2682826 A allele and excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks (OR = 1.75; 95%CI = 1.00-3.06, p = 0.048), SOD2 rs4880 T allele and nausea/vomiting (OR = 0.49, 95%CI = 0.25-0.94; p = 0.031), IL1\u03b2 rs1143623 C allele and orthostatic hypotension (OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.32-1.00, p = 0.050), and NOS1 rs2682826 A allele and impulse control disorders (OR = 2.59; 95%CI = 1.09-6.19; p = 0.032). We did not find any associations between selected polymorphisms and motor adverse events. Conclusions: Apart from some nominally significant associations, one significant association between CAT genetic variability and peripheral edema was observed as well. Therefore, the results of our study suggest some links between genetic variability in inflammation- and oxidative stress-related pathways and non-motor adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. However, the investigated polymorphisms do not play a major role in the occurrence of the disease and the adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. \u00a9 2019 The Author(s)."},

Multiple kernel learning and kernel approximation are often treated as separate tasks, with considerable savings in time and memory expected if the two are performed simultaneously. Our proposed Mklaren algorithm selectively approximates multiple kernel matrices in regression. It uses Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition and Least-angle regression (LAR) to select basis functions, achieving linear complexity both in the number of data points and kernels. Since it approximates kernel matrices rather than functions, it allows to combine an arbitrary set of kernels. Compared to single kernel-based approximations, it selectively approximates different kernels in different regions of the input spaces. The LAR criterion provides a robust selection of inducing points in noisy settings, and an accurate modelling of regression functions in continuous and discrete input spaces. Among general kernel matrix decompositions, Mklaren achieves minimal approximation rank required for performance comparable to using the exact kernel matrix, at a cost lower than 1% of required operations. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and interpretability in settings with millions of data points and thousands of kernels. \u00a9 2019 The Authors"},

We extensively demonstrate the strength of DAUs on a classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Compared to ConvNets with regular filter, ConvNets with DAUs achieve comparable performance at faster convergence and up to 3-times reduction in parameters.

To design the adaptive transmission schemes, it is important to understand the realistic channel properties, especially in vehicular environments where the mobility of communication devices causes rapid channel variation. However, getting CSI estimates is challenging due to the lack of support for obtaining CSI from the chipset. In this paper, we present our efforts towards enabling reliable, up-to-date channel estimates in vehicular communications. We begin by designing and conducting a measurement campaign where we collect IQ (in-phase and quadrature) samples of the IEEE 802.11p transmission and implement CSI extraction algorithms to obtain and analyze wireless channel estimates from various real-world environments. We then propose a deep learning-based channel prediction for predicting future CSI and received signal levels. The trace-based evaluation demonstrates that our prediction approach improves the future power level estimate by 15% to 25% in terms of the root-mean-square-error compared to the latest known channel properties, thus, providing a sound basis for future efforts in anticipatory vehicular communication transmission adaptation. \u00a9 2019 IEEE."},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether combined preoperative non-invasive determination of cardiac autonomic regulation and PR interval allows for the identification of patients at risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. Methods: RR, PR and QT intervals, and linear and non-linear heart rate variability parameters from 20 min high-resolution electrocardiographic recordings were determined one day before surgery in 150 patients on chronic beta blockers undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic valve replacement, or both, electively. Results: Thirty-one patients (21%)developed postoperative atrial fibrillation. In the atrial fibrillation group, more arterial hypertension, a greater age, a higher EuroSCORE II, a higher heart rate variability index (pNN50: 9 \u00b1 20 vs. 4 \u00b1 10, p = 0.050), a short PR interval (156 \u00b1 23 vs. 173 \u00b1 31 ms; p = 0.011), and a reduced short-term scaling exponent of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA1, 0.96 \u00b1 0.36 vs. 1.11 \u00b1 0.30 ms; p = 0.032)were found compared to the sinus rhythm group.

Several studies reported associations of dopaminergic genes with the occurrence of adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. However, none of these studies adopted a pathway based approach. The aim of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the influence of selected single nucleotide polymorphisms of key dopaminergic pathway genes on the occurrence of motor and non-motor adverse events of dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease. In total, 231 Parkinson's disease patients were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Genotyping was performed for 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms from key dopaminergic pathway genes. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were used for evaluation. Results were adjusted for significant clinical data. We observed that carriers of at least one COMT rs165815 C allele had lower odds for developing visual hallucinations (OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.16-0.72; p = 0.004), while carriers of at least one DRD3 rs6280 C allele and CC homozygotes had higher odds for this adverse event (OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.00-3.54; p = 0.049 and OR = 3.31; 95% CI = 1.37-8.03; p = 0.008, respectively). Carriers of at least one DDC rs921451 C allele and CT heterozygotes had higher odds for orthostatic hypotension (OR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.07-3.23; p = 0.028 and OR = 2.30; 95% CI = 1.26-4.20; p = 0.007, respectively). Heterozygotes for DDC rs3837091 and SLC22A1 rs628031 AA carriers also had higher odds for orthostatic hypotension (OR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.07 - 3.51; p = 0.028 and OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.11 - 5.95; p = 0.028, respectively). Carriers of the SLC22A1 rs628031 AA genotype had higher odds for peripheral edema and impulse control disorders (OR = 4.00; 95% CI = 1.62 - 9.88; p = 0.003 and OR = 3.16; 95% CI = 1.03 - 9.72; p = 0.045, respectively). Finally, heterozygotes for SLC22A1 rs628031 and carriers of at least one SLC22A1 rs628031 A allele had lower odds for dyskinesia (OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.24 - 0.98, p = 0.043 and OR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.25 - 0.92; p = 0.027, respectively). Gene-gene interactions, more specifically DDC-COMT, SLC18A2-SV2C, and SLC18A2-SLC6A3, also significantly influenced the occurrence of some adverse events. Additionally, haplotypes of COMT and SLC6A3 were associated with the occurrence of visual hallucinations (AT vs. GC: OR = 0.34; 95% CI = 0.16 - 0.72; p = 0.005) and orthostatic hypotension (ATG vs. ACG: OR = 2.48; 95% CI: 1.01 - 6.07; p = 0.047), respectively. Pathway based approach allowed us to identify new potential candidates for predictive biomarkers of adverse events of dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease, which could contribute to treatment personalization. \u00a9 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

In this work we focus on the acquisition of pairwise preferences in the music domain. Asking the user to explicitly compare music, i.e., which, among two listened tracks, is preferred, requires some user effort. We have therefore developed a novel approach for automatically extracting these preferences from the analysis of the facial expressions of the users while listening to the compared tracks. We have trained a predictor that infers user's pairwise preferences by using features extracted from these data. We show that the predictor performs better than a commonly used baseline, which leverages the user's listening duration of the tracks to infer pairwise preferences. Furthermore, we show that there are differences in the accuracy of the proposed method between users with different personalities and we have therefore adapted the trained model accordingly. Our work shows that by introducing a low user effort preference elicitation approach, which, however, requires to access information that may raise potential privacy issues (face expression), one can obtain good prediction accuracy of pairwise music preferences. \u00a9 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Lowering the stimulation frequency may reduce these symptoms. The objectives of the current study were to establish the relationship between gait performance and STN-DBS frequency in chronically stimulated patients with PD, and to identify factors underlying variability in this relationship. Twenty-four patients treated chronically with STN-DBS (&gt;4 years) were studied off-medication. The effect of stimulation frequency (40\u2013140 Hz, 20 Hz-steps, constant energy) on gait was assessed in 6 sessions spread over 1 day. Half of the trials/session involved walking through a narrow doorway. The influence of stimulation voltage was investigated separately in 10 patients. Gait was measured using 3D motion capture and axial symptoms severity was assessed clinically. A novel statistical method established the optimal frequency(ies) for each patient by operating on frequency-tuning curves for multiple gait parameters. Narrowly-tuned optimal frequencies (20 Hz bandwidth) were found in 79% of patients. Frequency change produced a larger effect on gait performance than voltage change. Optimal frequency varied between patients (between 60 and 140 Hz). Contact site in the right STN and severity of axial symptoms were independent predictors of optimal frequency (P = 0.009), with lower frequencies associated with more dorsal contacts and worse axial symptoms. We conclude that gait performance is sensitive to small changes in STN-DBS frequency. The optimal frequency varies considerably between patients and is associated with electrode contact site and severity of axial symptoms. Between-subject variability of optimal frequency may stem from variable pathology outside the basal ganglia.

{"id": "85066755727", "title": "Implementation and evaluation of algorithms with ALGATOr", "authors": ["Dobravec, T."], "abstract": "In this paper we present an automatic algorithm evaluation system called ALGATOR, which was developed to facilitate the algorithm design and evaluation process. The system enables unbiased tests of the correctness of the algorithm\u2019s results on given test cases and comparisons of the quality of implemented algorithms for solving various kinds of problems (e.g. sorting data, matrix multiplication, traveler salesman problem, shortest path problem, and the like). Within the ALGATOR one can define a problem by specifying the problem descriptors, test sets with corresponding test cases, input parameters and output indicators, algorithm specifications and criteria for measuring the quality of algorithms. When a user of the system submits an algorithm for solving a given problem, ALGATOR automatically executes this algorithm on predefined tests, measures the quality indicators and prepares the results to be compared with the results of other algorithms in the system. The ALGATOR is meant to be used by algorithm developers to perform independent quality tests for their solutions. \u00a9 2019 Slovene Society Informatika. All rights reserved."},

Currently, NMTF learns a representation of a dataset through an optimization procedure that typically uses multiplicative update rules. This procedure has had limited success, and its failure cases have not been well understood. We here perform an empirical study involving six large datasets comparing multiplicative update rules with three alternative optimization methods, including alternating least squares, projected gradients, and coordinate descent. We find that methods based on projected gradients and coordinate descent converge up to twenty-four times faster than multiplicative update rules. Furthermore, alternating least squares method can quickly train NMTF models on sparse datasets but often fails on dense datasets. Coordinate descent-based NMTF converges up to sixteen times faster compared to well-established methods. \u00a9 2019 \u010copar et al.

The role of an argument-based intelligent tutoring system is then to train the students to find the most relevant arguments. The students learn about the high-level domain concepts and then use them to argue about automatically selected examples.

A novel mechanism based on the correlation response is used for tracking failure estimation. FuCoLoT achieves state-of-the-art results on standard short-term benchmarks and it outperforms the current best-performing tracker on the long-term UAV20L benchmark by over 19%.
